# Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews Analysis

This project is a data analysis of Sephora products and skincare reviews dataset from Kaggle.  
I worked on cleaning the data, handling missing values and outliers, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key insights such as top products, brand ratings, and price distributions.

## Project Files

- `Sephora_Data_Analysis.ipynb` ‚Äî (Google Colab) with the full analysis and visualizations.  
- ` product_info.csv` ‚Äî The dataset file (if included; if the file is too large, it might be hosted externally).

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/username/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews) *(replace the link with the actual dataset link)*.
